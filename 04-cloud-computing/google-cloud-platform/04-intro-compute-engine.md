# How to Create a Virtual Machine on Google Compute Engine

This README file provides instructions on how to create a virtual machine (VM) on Google Compute Engine.

## What is Google Compute Engine?

Google Compute Engine is a Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google's infrastructure. It offers a variety of machine types and regions, so you can choose the right configuration for your needs.

## Steps to Create a VM on Google Compute Engine

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform project.
2. Enable the Compute Engine API.
3. Select a machine type and region.
4. Create a boot disk.
5. Create a network and firewall rules.
6. Create a VM instance.

## Creating a Google Cloud Platform Project

To create a Google Cloud Platform project, follow the instructions in the [How to Create a Project in Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/projects) documentation.

## Enabling the Compute Engine API

To enable the Compute Engine API, follow the instructions in the [Enabling the Compute Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/enabling-apis) documentation.

## Selecting a Machine Type and Region

A machine type is the configuration of the VM, such as the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and storage. A region is a geographic location where the VM will be hosted.

To select a machine type and region, follow the instructions in the [Choosing a Machine Type and Region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/choosing-machine-type-and-region) documentation.

## Creating a Boot Disk

The boot disk is the storage for the VM's operating system and data. You can create a boot disk from a variety of sources, such as a Google Cloud Storage bucket or an existing VM.

To create a boot disk, follow the instructions in the [Creating a Boot Disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/creating) documentation.

## Creating a Network and Firewall Rules

A network is a logical grouping of VMs. You can create a network and firewall rules to control the traffic between VMs and the internet.

To create a network and firewall rules, follow the instructions in the [Creating a Network and Firewall Rules](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls) documentation.

## Creating a VM Instance

A VM instance is a running VM. To create a VM instance, you need to specify the machine type, region, boot disk, network, and firewall rules.

To create a VM instance, follow the instructions in the [Creating a VM Instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating) documentation.
