# How to Create a Dataset and a Table in Google BigQuery Using Open Source Data

This README file provides instructions on how to create a dataset and a table using open source data in Google BigQuery.

## What is Google BigQuery?

Google BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective cloud data warehouse that enables you to analyze all your data very quickly. It is a good choice for storing and analyzing large datasets.

## What is Open Source Data?

Open source data is data that is freely available to anyone to use and modify. There are many open source datasets available, including datasets on demographics, weather, and financial markets.

## Steps to Create a Dataset and a Table in Google BigQuery Using Open Source Data

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform project.
2. Enable the BigQuery API.
3. Create a dataset.
4. Create a table.
5. Load data into the table.

## Creating a Google Cloud Platform Project

To create a Google Cloud Platform project, follow the instructions in the [How to Create a Project in Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/projects) documentation.

## Enabling the BigQuery API

To enable the BigQuery API, follow the instructions in the [Enabling the BigQuery API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/enabling-apis) documentation.

## Creating a Dataset

A dataset is a collection of tables in BigQuery. To create a dataset, follow the instructions in the [Creating a Dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) documentation.

## Creating a Table

A table is a collection of rows and columns in BigQuery. To create a table, follow the instructions in the [Creating a Table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables) documentation.

## Loading Data into the Table

You can load data into a table from a variety of sources, such as Google Cloud Storage, Cloud Pub/Sub, and a local file. To load data into a table, follow the instructions in the [Loading Data](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data) documentation.

## Using Open Source Data in BigQuery

There are many open source datasets available in BigQuery. To use an open source dataset, you need to know the dataset ID. You can find the dataset ID in the [BigQuery Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) documentation.

Once you have the dataset ID, you can create a table in BigQuery and load the data from the open source dataset.
