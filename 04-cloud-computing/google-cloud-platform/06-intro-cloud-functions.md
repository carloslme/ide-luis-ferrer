# How to Deploy an Open Cloud Function with Python

This README file provides instructions on how to deploy an open cloud function with Python.

## What is Google Cloud Functions?

Google Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that allows you to run code in response to events. Events can be HTTP requests, Cloud Pub/Sub messages, or other types of events.

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is popular for its simplicity and readability. It is a good choice for writing cloud functions because it is easy to learn and use.

## Steps to Deploy an Open Cloud Function with Python

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform project.
2. Enable the Cloud Functions API.
3. Create a function.
4. Deploy the function.

## Creating a Google Cloud Platform Project

To create a Google Cloud Platform project, follow the instructions in the [How to Create a Project in Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/projects) documentation.

## Enabling the Cloud Functions API

To enable the Cloud Functions API, follow the instructions in the [Enabling the Cloud Functions API](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/enabling-apis) documentation.

## Creating a Function

A function is a unit of code that is triggered by an event. To create a function, you need to specify the trigger, the runtime, and the code.

The trigger can be an HTTP request, Cloud Pub/Sub message, or other types of events. The runtime is the environment in which the code will be executed. The code is the Python code that will be executed when the function is triggered.

To create a function, you can use the Google Cloud Platform Console or the gcloud command-line tool.

## Deploying the Function

Once you have created a function, you need to deploy it. Deploying a function makes it available to be triggered by events.

To deploy a function, you can use the Google Cloud Platform Console or the gcloud command-line tool.
